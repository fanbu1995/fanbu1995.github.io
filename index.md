# Welcome to Fan's webpage!

I am a tenure-track assistant professor in Biostatistics at the University of Michigan. Previously I was a postdoctoral research fellow at UCLA, working with Dr. Marc Suchard to develop Bayesian statistical methods for analyzing large-scale observational health data. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Statistics from Duke University under the supervision of Dr. Alexander Volfovsky in Fall 2021. 


My research interests include:

- Bayesian statistics and computation for temporal / spatio-temporal processes, networks, and federated data

- Health data science and observational study for comparative effectiveness and safety

I am an active member of [Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI)](https://www.ohdsi.org/), 
a global collaborative for health data science research to promote better health decisions and patient care. 
My main activities within OHDSI include statistical methods development and leading large network studies.
