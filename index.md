# Welcome to Fan's webpage!

I am a postdoctoral research fellow at University of California, Los Angeles, working with Dr. Marc Suchard to develop Bayesian statistical methods for analyzing large-scale observational health data. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Statistics from Duke University under the supervision of Dr. Alexander Volfovsky in Fall 2021, with a dissertation on [stochatic processes models on and of dynamic networks](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2583399863?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true).

My research interests include:

- Bayesian statistics and machine learning for complex and large-scale datasets
- Stochastic processes and dynamic models
- Health data science and informatics
- Computational social science

I also enjoy writing, sports, and music. I have an occasionally updated blog [here](https://fanbublog.wordpress.com/) (mostly written in Chinese).
