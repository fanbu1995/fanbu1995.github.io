# Welcome to my website!

My name is Fan Bu. I am a postdoctoral scholar at University of California, Los Angeles, working with Dr. Marc Suchard to develop Bayesian statistical methods for large-scale observational observational health data. I recently obtained my Ph.D. degree in Statistics from Duke University under the supervision of Dr. Alexander Volfovsky. My research interests include:

- Bayesian Statistics and Machine Learning
- Stochastic Modelling
- Network Analysis
- With applications in infectious disease modeling, health sciences, social sciences, sports analytics, and natural language processing

I also love writing, sports, and music. I have an occasionally updated blog [here](https://fanbublog.wordpress.com/) (mostly written in Chinese).
