## Basics

I received my Bachelor's degree in _Data Science and Big Data Technology_ from Peking University, China in 2017. [My graduation paper (in **Chinese**)](https://fanbuduke17.github.io/Graduation_Paper.pdf)

I am a Ph.D. student in Statistics at Duke University, under the supervision of my advisor [Alexander Volfovsky](https://volfovsky.github.io/). My research interests are:

- Machine Learning
- Network Analysis
- Stochastic Modelling
- Sports Data Analytics

I have just finished a project on the higher-order latent social network structure in basketball player passes, using high-resolution data collected by a renowned NCAA basketball program (appeared in the proceedings of [AiStats 2019](https://www.aistats.org/)). I am currently working on modeling stochastic epidemic processes on adaptive networks.

## I Love Writing

I have a blog [here](https://fanbublog.wordpress.com/), mostly written in **Chinese**; the majority of the contents are movie reviews, tennis stories and random babblings. 

[//]: # I will gradually translate some of my past works into **English** and post them on the [blog page](https://https://fanbuduke17.github.io/blog).
