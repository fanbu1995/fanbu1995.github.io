## Basics

I recently received my Bachelor's degree in Data Science and Big Data Technology from Peking University, China. [My graduation paper (in **Chinese**)](https://fanbuduke17.github.io/Graduation_Paper.pdf)

I am now a Ph.D. student in Statistics at Duke University, under the supervision of my first-year advisor [Katherine Heller](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~kheller/). My research interests are:

- Non-parametric Bayesian Statistics
- Machine Learning
- Network Analysis
- Stochastic Modelling
- Sports Data Analytics

## Skills and Hobbies

* Languages: Mandarin (native), English (fluent), and French(beginner's level)
* Programming Languages: Python, R, Matlab, Julia (a tiny bit) and LaTex
* Music: piano and drums; there used to be a time when I could play the French Horn
* Sports: jogging, swimming, yoga, badminton, squash, ping pong, and tennis.

## I love writing

I have a blog [here](http://fanny-hi.lofter.com/), where I post movie reviews, tennis reviews and babblings. Note that it's in **Chinese**.

I will gradually translate some of my past works into **English** and post them here.
