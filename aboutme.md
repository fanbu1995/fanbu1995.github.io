## Basics

I received my Bachelor's degree in _Data Science and Big Data Technology_ from Peking University, China in 2017. [My graduation paper (in **Chinese**)](https://fanbuduke17.github.io/Graduation_Paper.pdf)

I am a Ph.D. student in Statistics at Duke University, under the supervision of my advisor [Alexander Volfovsky](https://volfovsky.github.io/). My research interests are:

- Machine Learning
- Network Analysis
- Stochastic Modelling
- Sports Data Analytics

I have just finished a project on likelihood-based inference of epidemic processes on adaptive social networks, with [Allison Aiello](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/allison-e-aiello-phd/), Alexander Volfovsky and [Jason Xu](https://jasonxu90.github.io/). We developed a continuous-time Markov process model and a Bayesian data augmentation inference framework to study the interplay between contagion spread and social network evolution. The model is applied to recent epidemiological data with time-resolved social contact observations ([Aiello et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436516000025)).

My project before that was on the higher-order latent structure in basketball player passes, using high-resolution data collected by a renowned NCAA basketball program (in the proceedings of [AiStats 2019](https://www.aistats.org/)).

## I Love Writing

I have a blog [here](https://fanbublog.wordpress.com/), mostly written in **Chinese**; the majority of the contents are movie reviews, tennis stories and random babblings. 

I have (slowly) taken up writing in English and started posting things on the [blog page](https://fanbuduke17.github.io/blog).

[//]: # I will gradually translate some of my past works into **English** and post them on the [blog page](https://fanbuduke17.github.io/blog).
