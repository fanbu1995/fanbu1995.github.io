## Basics

I received my Bachelor's degree in _Data Science and Big Data Technology_ from Peking University, China in 2017. [My graduation paper (in **Chinese**)](https://fanbuduke17.github.io/Graduation_Paper.pdf)

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at Duke University, working under the supervision of my advisor [Dr. Alexander Volfovsky](https://volfovsky.github.io/). My research interests include:

- Bayesian Statistics and Machine Learning
- Network Analysis
- Stochastic Modelling
- With applications in infectious disease modeling, sports analytics, natural language processing and healthcare data analysis

I am currently analyzing experimental data to identify immunological predictors for HIV viral rebound, which often occurs after interrupting antiretroviral treatments for patients. This work is part of my research internship with Duke Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) starting May 2020, in collaboration with the project PI Dr. Sallie Permar, and quantitative PIs Drs. Cliburn Chan and Janice McCarthy. 

At the same time, I am working on stochastic epidemic modeling with consideration of contact networks or social mobility. Earlier this year, our paper [_Likelihood-based Inference for Partially Observed Epidemics on Dynamic Networks_](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2020.1790376) was accepted by Journal of the American Statistical Association (JASA); it was also one of the 10 winners of the 2020 SBSS student paper award, and has been selected as one of the ["research highlights" of JSM 2020](https://www.amstat.org/ASA/News/Newsworthy-Research-Highlights-from-JSM-2020.aspx).

I have just finished a project on likelihood-based inference of epidemic processes on adaptive social networks, with [Allison Aiello](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/allison-e-aiello-phd/), Alexander Volfovsky and [Jason Xu](https://jasonxu90.github.io/). We developed a continuous-time Markov process model and a Bayesian data augmentation inference framework to study the interplay between contagion spread and social network evolution. The model is applied to recent epidemiological data with time-resolved social contact observations ([Aiello et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436516000025)).

One of my previous projects was about uncovering higher-order latent structures in basketball player passes, using high-resolution data collected by a renowned NCAA basketball program ([paper in the proceedings of AiStats 2019](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v89/bu19a/bu19a.pdf)).

## Not-so-basics
  
* I like music  
  I play the piano and drums; once upon a time I could play the French Horn too. 
  
* And sports...    
  Jogging, swimming, yoga, badminton, squash, ping pong, and tennis. I used to manage social media accounts for the Wimbledon Championships (yes, **that** Wimbledon) and write tennis commentaries back in college.  
  
* I love writing

  I have a blog [here](https://fanbublog.wordpress.com/), mostly written in **Chinese**; the majority of the contents are movie reviews, tennis stories and random babblings. I have also (slowly) taken up writing in English and started posting things on the [blog page](https://fanbuduke17.github.io/blog).
