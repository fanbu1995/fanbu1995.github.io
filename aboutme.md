- Non-parametric Bayesian Statistics
- Machine Learning
- Network Analysis

# Skills and Hobbies

I speak Mandarin and English fluently, and I also know a tiny bit of French.

I program in Python, R and Matlab. I use Julia and LaTex as well.

I play the piano and the drums. There used to be a time when I could play the French Horn.

I jog, swim, yoga, play badminton, squash, and tennis.

I read books in History, Sociology, Economics, and Philosophy.

**I love writing.**  
I have a blog [here](http://fanny-hi.lofter.com/), where I post movie reviews, tennis reviews and babblings. Note that it's in **Chinese**.
