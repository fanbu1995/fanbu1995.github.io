### "Root Probability" Identification Using Multivariate Hawkes Processes with Texual Marks

- Ongoing project with [Wei Zhang](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~zhangwei/) and [Derek Owens-Oas](https://stat.duke.edu/people/derek-owens-oas), supervised by [Jerry Zhu](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jerryzhu/) and [Katherine Heller](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~kheller/).
- With applications in social media networks, eg. [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) forum data.

### Traffic Speed Nowcasting Based on Urban Road Network and Artificial Neural Network
- Graduation project for my B.S. in Peking University. [Chinese version](https://fanbuduke17.github.io/Graduation_Paper.pdf)
- A deep learning project involving Graph CNN, LSTM network, and real-time traffic speed data obtained from taxi GPS record.

### Detection of Differential Genetic Networks
- Undergraduate research project funded by Chinese National Inovative Initiative.
- Won the second prize of the Peking University Research Challenge Cup.
