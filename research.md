#### Learning Root Source with Marked Multivariate Hawkes Processes

- Project with [Wei Zhang](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~zhangwei/) and [Derek Owens-Oas](https://stat.duke.edu/people/derek-owens-oas), supervised by [Jerry Zhu](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jerryzhu/) and [Katherine Heller](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~kheller/).
- With applications in text cascades on social networks, eg. [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) forum comment data.
- Submitted paper to AiStats 2018.
  
#### Traffic Speed Nowcasting Based on Urban Road Network and Artificial Neural Network
- Graduation project for my B.S. in Peking University. [Chinese version](https://fanbuduke17.github.io/Graduation_Paper.pdf)
- A deep learning project involving Graph CNN, LSTM network, and real-time traffic speed data obtained from taxi GPS record.
  
#### Detection of Differential Genetic Networks
- Undergraduate research project funded by Chinese National Innovative Initiative.
- Won the second prize of the Peking University Research Challenge Cup.
