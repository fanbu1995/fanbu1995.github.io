<img align="right" src="https://fanbu1995.github.io/img/exFlu_data.png" alt="exFLU data visualization" width="350" height="195">


- Joint work with [Allison Aiello](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/allison-e-aiello-phd/), [Alexander Volfovsky](https://volfovsky.github.io/), and [Jason Xu](https://jasonxu90.github.io/).
- Proposed a stochastic generative model and a data augmentation inference scheme for epidemic processes on dynamic, adaptive contact networks. 
- With applications in analyzing recent, real-world epidemiological data with high resolution social contacts observations.
- [Paper published](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2020.1790376) in Journal of the American Statistical Association (JASA).
- One of 10 winners of the 2020 SBSS Student Paper Award; also selected as one of the ["research highlights" of JSM 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200812215439/https://www.amstat.org/ASA/News/Newsworthy-Research-Highlights-from-JSM-2020.aspx).

#### SMOGS: Social Network Metrics of Game Success

<img align="right" src="https://fanbu1995.github.io/img/lost_game_AME.png" alt="Latent factors in a lost game" width="300" height="170">

- Joint work with Sonia Xu, [Katherine Heller](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~kheller/), and Alexander Volfovsky.
- The main goal is to model the latent higher-order network structures in (basketball) player interactions that contribute to overall game outcomes and evaluate both individual- and group-level interaction choices and preferences. 
- Model applied to high-resolution optical tracking data collected by a top collegiate basketball program.
- [In the proceedings of AiStats 2019.](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v89/bu19a/bu19a.pdf)

- With applications in group conversations between online users or individuals in real-life settings, eg. [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) forum comment data, and transcription of the movie [12 Angry Men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_Angry_Men_(1957_film)).
- [arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03648)

- Ongoing research with Alexander Volfovsky, Raquel Asencio, James Moody, and Katherine Heller.
- The goal is to study the mechanisms of small team and multi-team systems and to develop metrics for evaluating team effectiveness, cohesion, and leadership.
- Observational study and data collection completed; data analysis and manuscript preparation underway.

#### Modeling HIV transmission flow from deep-sequencing data. 

<!--img align="right" src="https://fanbu1995.github.io/img/HIV_flow_trace.png" alt="HIV flow tracing" width="100" height="250"-->

- Ongoing work with Jason Xu and Oliver Ratmann (Imperial College London).
- Developing a spatial Poisson process with Gaussian mixture densities to describe HIV transmission flow between gender and age groups.
- Building a hierarchical Bayesian inference framework to utilize rich information from high-volume deep-sequencing data collected from real patients.

### Collaboration Work and Other Projects Since 2017

#### Identifying Immune Correlates for HIV Viral Rebound of Infant Rhesus Macaques

<img align="right" src="https://fanbu1995.github.io/img/B2_viral_load_postATI_plot.png" alt="Viral load curves" width="350" height="200">

- Ongoing experimental data analysis in collaboration with Duke Center for AIDS Research (CFAR), in collaboration with the project PI Dr. Sallie Permar, and quantitative PIs Drs. Cliburn Chan and Janice McCarthy. 
- Using survival analysis and sparse regression methods to identify meaningful immunological predictors for time to HIV viral rebound.

#### Analyzing Fandom Perceptions of Marvel Cinematic Universe Characters from Fanfictions


<img align="right" src="https://fanbu1995.github.io/img/Cap_Topic_Scores.png" alt="Captain America Fanfiction perceptions" width="350" height="200">


- Adapted dynamic topic modeling methods to analyze dynamic topics associated with popular MCU characters in over 1000 fanfictions composed from 2008 to 2018
- Crawled famous fanfiction website [Archive of Our Own](https://archiveofourown.org/) to collect a large body of text data
- Findings: 1) introduction of new characters has contributed to diverse fanfiction creations, and 2) multi-dimensional character development is well-received by the fandom. 
- [Technical report on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03774.pdf) (Image: fanfiction topics associated with Captain America have developed and evolved over the years)


#### Historical Tone Change from Middle Chinese to Modern Beijing Mandarin: Usage-based Phonology and Modeling

- Ongoing work with Haowen Zhang and Maria Giavazzi, Ecole Normale Sup´erieure de Paris.
- Using statistical machine learning methods to identify phonetic features related to the tone change of "_ru_" characters (“入声字”) in Beijing Mandarin, and developing dynamical models for the tone change process based on usage-based phonology theory.
