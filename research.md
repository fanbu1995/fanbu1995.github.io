### Recent research work

#### Bayesian Safety Surveillance with Adaptive Bias Correction

<img align="right" src="https://fanbu1995.github.io/img/Bayesian-sequential-demo.png" alt="Bayesian posterior updates extract sequential evidence with transparency" width="300" height="170">

- In collaboration with US FDA CBER [BEST Initiative](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/cber-biologics-effectiveness-and-safety-best-system); [Study protocol available online.](https://suchard-group.github.io/Better/Protocol.html)
- Proposed a Bayesian sequential analysis framework for post-market vaccine surveillance, with a joint statistical model to correct for bias induced by systematic error in obervational data.
- Improved flexibility and convenience over state-of-the-art approaches, while producing more reliable, interpretable and transparent results.
- (Manuscript available upon request, pending funders' approval)

#### Learning HIV transmission transmission patterns from viral deep-sequencing data. 

<img align="right" src="https://fanbu1995.github.io/img/HIV-transmission-data.png" alt="HIV flow tracing" width="300" height="170">

- Developed a hierarchical spatial Poisson process model and Bayesian inference scheme to uncover population-level HIV transmission patterns.
- Leveraged latent variable auxiliary sampling and a marked point process design to infer latent transmission links from viral deep-sequencing data.
- Significantly improved computational efficiency compared to existing approaches, while providing uncertainty quantification for lower-confidence data evidence.
- [Preprint](https://fanbu1995.github.io/Documents/HIV_transmission_methodsOnly.pdf) (real data section redacted due to data regulations); full manuscript with case study results under extended data consortium review, available upon request.


#### Likelihood-based Inference for Partially Observed Epidemics on Dynamic Networks. 

<img align="right" src="https://fanbu1995.github.io/img/exFlu_data.png" alt="exFLU data visualization" width="350" height="195">

- Proposed a stochastic generative model and a data-augmented inference scheme for epidemic processes on dynamic, adaptive contact networks. 
- With applications in analyzing modern partially observed epidemic data with high resolution contact tracing.
- [Paper published](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2020.1790376) in Journal of the American Statistical Association (JASA).
- One of 10 winners of the 2020 SBSS Student Paper Award; selected as one of the ["research highlights" of JSM 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200812215439/https://www.amstat.org/ASA/News/Newsworthy-Research-Highlights-from-JSM-2020.aspx).
- [Extended work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07892) with disease latency and individual covariates modeling (evaluating effects of interventions such as hand-washing and vaccination) under revisions for _Annals of Applied Statistics_.

#### SMOGS: Social Network Metrics of Game Success

<img align="right" src="https://fanbu1995.github.io/img/lost_game_AME.png" alt="Latent factors in a lost game" width="300" height="170">

- Combined latent factor models with spatio-temporal processes to uncover latent higher-order patterns in (basketball) player interactions that contribute to overall game outcomes.
- Applied to high-resolution optical tracking data collected by a top collegiate basketball program.
- [In the proceedings of AiStats 2019.](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v89/bu19a/bu19a.pdf)
  
#### Learning Root Source with Marked Multivariate Hawkes Processes


<img align="right" src="https://fanbu1995.github.io/img/12AngryMen.png" alt="12 Angry Men conversation thread" width="300" height="170">

- Proposed marked multivariate Hawkes process model with efficient variational Bayesian inference algorithm to uncover latent replying structure in textual conversations.
- Applied to analyze conversation flow and social power dynamics in group conversations between online users and individuals in real-life settings, eg. [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) forum comment data, and transcription of the movie [12 Angry Men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_Angry_Men_(1957_film)).
- [arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03648)
