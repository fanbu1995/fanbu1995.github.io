#### Modeling the Co-evolution of Epidemic Spreading and Dynamic Contact Networks

- Ongoing research with [Alexander Volfovsky](https://volfovsky.github.io/).

#### How Dynamic Mechanisms Facilitate Effectiveness in Teamwork

- Ongoing research with Alexander Volfovsky, Raquel Asencio, James Moody, and Katherine Heller.

#### SMOGS: Social Network Metrics of Game Success

- Joint work with Sonia Xu, [Katherine Heller](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~kheller/), and [Alexander Volfovsky](https://volfovsky.github.io/).
- The main goal is to model the latent higher-order network structures in (basketball) player interactions that contribute to overall game outcomes and evaluate both individual- and group-level interaction choices and preferences. The model is applied to high-resolution optical tracking data collected by a top collegiate basketball program.
- Accepted by AiStats 2019.
  
#### Learning Root Source with Marked Multivariate Hawkes Processes

- Joint work with [Wei Zhang](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~zhangwei/), [Derek Owens-Oas](https://stat.duke.edu/people/derek-owens-oas), [Jerry Zhu](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jerryzhu/), and [Katherine Heller](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~kheller/).
- With applications in group conversations between online users or individuals in real-life settings, eg. [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) forum comment data, and transcription of the movie [12 Angry Men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_Angry_Men_(1957_film)).
- Submitted to NAACL'19.
  
#### Traffic Speed Nowcasting Based on Urban Road Network and Artificial Neural Network
- Graduation project for my B.S. in Peking University. [Chinese version](https://fanbuduke17.github.io/Graduation_Paper.pdf)
- A deep learning project involving Graph CNN, LSTM network, and real-time traffic speed data obtained from taxi GPS tracking records.
  
#### Detection of Differential Genetic Networks
- Undergraduate research project funded by Chinese National Innovative Initiative.
- Won the second prize of the Peking University Research Challenge Cup.
